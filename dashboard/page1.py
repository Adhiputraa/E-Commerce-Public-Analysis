            Based on the dataset, SÃ£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are the top two cities with the highest number of customers, with SÃ£o Paulo ranking first and Rio de Janeiro second.
            This observation aligns with data from World Population Review, which indicates that SÃ£o Paulo is the largest city in Brazil with a population of approximately 22.8 million in 2024, while Rio de Janeiro follows with around 13.8 million residents [World Population Review](https://worldpopulationreview.com/cities/brazil)â€‹.
            The high population density in these cities is reflected in their dominance in e-commerce transactions, as they house a large customer base, contributing significantly to Brazil's overall online marketplace activity.
